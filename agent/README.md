# Agent Communication Protocol

This protocol defines an interface for interacting with your agent.

When you use this protocol, your agent becomes automatically deployable to the [e2b platform](https://e2b.dev).

Because this protocol is open-source, any other service can adopt it and your agent then becomes automatically compatible with it.

## Installation
