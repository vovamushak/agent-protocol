# Test compliance

To check if your agent is compliant with the Agent Protocol, you can use the [Agent Protocol SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/agent-protocol/sdk/python). The SDK is written in `python`. {{ className: 'lead' }}

You can install by running the following command:

```shell
pip install agent-protocol
```

after that you can simply run the following command to test your agent:

```shell
agent-protocol test --url <your-agent-url>
```

The command will run a series of tests against your agent endpoints and check if the responses are compliant with the Agent Protocol.
