# Agent Protocol RFC

Agent Protocol should be a product of a community of agent builder. We want to work with the community to define the protocol in a way that is easy to understand and implement.
RFC is a place where we can discuss and propose new ideas for the project.

2. Create a new file in `rfcs` folder with the name `your-rfc-name.md`
3. Write your RFC
4. Create a PR to `main` branch
5. Discuss and iterate on your RFC
6. By default RFCs are accepted after week of discussion
