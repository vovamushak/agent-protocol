# Agent Protocol

The agent space is young and the need for standard protocol should be evident. It will help the ecosystem grow faster and simplify the integrations. For some applications it‚Äôs even crucial. We don‚Äôt want to build on wrong assumptions by defining a complex protocol.

We are starting with a minimal core and we want to build upon that iteratively by learning from agent developers about what they actually need.

The Agent Protocol is a API specification - list of endpoints, which the agent should expose with predefined response models.

This protocol defines an interface for interacting with your agent.

The protocol is **tech stack agnostic**. Any agent can adopt this protocol no
matter what framework they're using (or not using).

Because this protocol is open-source, any platform can adopt it and your agent
then becomes automatically compatible with it.

## Components

### [Protocol](./openapi.yml)

The most important part. It specifies which endpoints should the agent expose. The protocol is defined in [OpenAPI specification](./openapi.yml).

#### How does the protocol work?

Right now the protocol is defined as a REST API (via the [OpenAPI spec](./openapi.yml)) with two essential routes for interaction with your agent:

- `POST /agent/tasks` for creating a new task for the agent (for example giving the agent an objective that you want to accomplish)
- `POST /agent/tasks/{task_id}/steps` for executing one step of the defined task

We found out that a lot of agents are structured into ‚Äústeps‚Äù ‚Äì usually these steps are either iterations of the core agent loop or just parts of the code with a call to the LLM. These steps are non-deterministic and you want to have control over them when developing, testing, and controlling your agent.

### [SDK](./agent)

It should simplify the implementation of the protocol to the bare minimumbut at the same time it shouldn‚Äôt tie your hands. The goal should be to allow agent builders to build their agents and the SDK should solve the rest.

Basically it wraps your agent in a web server that allows for communication with your agent (and in between agents in the future).

### [Client SDK](./agent_client)

Allows users to interact with the agent easily. Thanks to the standard the users can try multiple agents without the need for any additional adjustments (or very minimal) in their code.

## The incentives to adopt the protocol

- Ease with which you can use the benchmarks.
- Other people can more easily use and integrate your agent
- Enable building general devtools (for development, deployment and monitoring) that
  can be built on top of this protocol
- You don‚Äôt need to write boilerplate API and you can focus on developing your agent

## Immediate goals of the protocol

Set a general simple standard that would allow for easy to use benchmarking of agents. One of the primary goals of the protocol is great developer experience, and simple implementation on the end of agent developers. You just start your agent and that‚Äôs all you have to do.

## Installation

Install one of the official libraries or implement the protocol spec on your own by following the [OpenAPI file](https://github.com/e2b-dev/agent-protocol/blob/main/openapi.yml).

### Currently supported languages (SDKs):

- [Python](#python-sdk)
- [JavaScript/TypeScript](#javascripttypescript-sdk)

**Please open an issue for a request to support your favorite language.**

### Python SDK

```sh
pip install agent-protocol
```

You can find the full example
[in the Python SDK directory](./agent/python/README.md)

### JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

```sh
npm i agent-protocol
```

You can find the full example [in the JS/TS SDK directory](./agent/js/README.md)

## Usage (builders)

### Python SDK

You can find the full example
[in the Python SDK directory](./agent/python/README.md)

### JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

You can find the full example [in the JS/TS SDK directory](./agent/js/README.md)

### Test compliance with the protocol

You can test your agent's compliance with the protocol by installing the python package:

```sh
pip install agent-protocol
```

and then running the following command:

```sh
agent-protocol test --url <your-agent-url>
```

#### Validator as a part of CI Pipeline

We advise you to add the validator as a part of your CI pipeline. It‚Äôs very minimal and the setup is simple.

```yaml
jobs:
  publish:
    name: Validate agent protocol compliance
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'

      - name: Install agent protocol
        run: pip install agent-protocol

      - name: Run agent
        run: <command to run your agent>

      - name: Validate agent protocol compliance
        run: agent-protocol test --url <your-agent-url>
```

You can then add a badge to your agent to show it‚Äôs agent protocol compliant.

```markdown
![Agent protocol](https://github.com/<OWNER>/<REPOSITORY>/actions/workflows/<WORKFLOW_FILENAME>/badge.svg)
```

## Usage (Clients)

This section shows how you can easily interact with the agent compliant with the agent protocol.

### Python

```python
import requests

url = "http://localhost:8000"

# Create task
response = requests.post(f"{url}/agent/tasks", json={"input": "task-input-to-your-agent"})
task_id = response.json()["task_id"]

# Execute steps until the completion
while (step := requests.post(f"{url}/agent/tasks/{task_id}/steps")) and not step.json()['is_last']:
    print("Interim output:", step.json()["output"])

# Print output
print("Done!", step.json()["output"])
```

### JS

```JavaScript
const url = 'http://localhost:8000'
const body = JSON.stringify({input: "task-input-to-your-agent"})

// Create task
let response = await fetch(`${url}/agent/tasks`, {method: 'POST'}, {body})
let data = await response.json()

const taskId = data.task_id
let isLast = false

// Execute steps until the completion
while (!isLast) {
  response = await fetch(`${url}/agent/tasks/${taskId}/steps`, {method: 'POST'})
  data = await response.json()
  isLast = data.is_last
}

// Print output
console.log('Done!', data.output)

```

### Client SDK

- [Python](./agent_client/python/README.md#getting-started)

### cURL

To **create a task** run:

```sh
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/agent/tasks \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
	"input": "task-input-to-your-agent"
}'
```

You will get a response like this:

```json
{
  "input": "task-input-to-your-agent",
  "task_id": "e6d768bb-4c50-4007-9853-aeffb46c77be",
  "artifacts": []
}
```

Then to **execute one step of the task** copy the `task_id` you got from the previous request and run:

```sh
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/agent/tasks/<task-id>/steps
```

To get response like this:

```json
{
  "output": "output-from-the-agent",
  "artifacts": [],
  "is_last": false,
  "input": null,
  "task_id": "e6d768bb-4c50-4007-9853-aeffb46c77be",
  "step_id": "8ff8ba39-2c3e-4246-8086-fbd2a897240b"
}
```

### Creating your own SDK that implements the protocol

The protocol is described in the OpenAPI spec in
[this file](https://github.com/e2b-dev/agent-protocol/blob/main/openapi.yml).
You can create your own SDK that implements this protocol just by implementing
the spec.

We tried for the current implementations to be fairly simple (please let us know
if you think this isn't true). You can get inspired by looking in a source code
of the official
[Python SDK](https://github.com/e2b-dev/agent-protocol/tree/main/agent/python/agent_protocol).

> We plan to add a GraphQL support in the future.
